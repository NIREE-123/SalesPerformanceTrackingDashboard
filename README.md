Project Overview This Excel project analyzes sales data for office products like laptops, desks, printers, office chairs, and mobiles. The main "orders" sheet tracks 125+ orders with details like order ID, date, customer, region (North, South, East, West), salesperson, product, quantity (1-7 units), unit price (₹7,500-₹55,000), discount (0-8%), and payment status (Paid, Pending, Unpaid). Revenue is calculated only for Paid orders: Net Revenue = Quantity × Unit Price × (1 - Discount/100).​

Main Tasks Clean Data: Fix issues like missing salesperson names, duplicate order IDs (e.g., O080 twice), inconsistent dates/names (e.g., "neha sharma" vs. "Neha Sharma"), and blank revenue for non-Paid orders. These cause errors in totals and charts.

Calculate Revenue: Use formulas to fill Net Revenue and Revenue columns. West region has highest Net Revenue (₹1,858,965), total revenue is ₹5,931,000, and 14.17% orders are Unpaid/Pending.​

Monthly/Product Summary: Extract month from dates, create subsheet in which product and in which shows highest sold quantity product— Mobile recorded the highest total quantity sold in the month of March (58 units)., Mobile sold highest quantity (145 units total).​

Key Findings Discounts show weak link to revenue (correlation -0.0255)—higher discounts slightly lower revenue, but quantity and demand matter more. Laptops give high revenue per unit despite fewer sales.​

Why It Matters This builds data cleaning, formula, pivot, and KPI skills for junior analyst jobs. Create dashboards showing region sales, top products, and payment risks to support the business decision.
